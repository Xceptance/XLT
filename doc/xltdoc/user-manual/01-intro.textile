h2. About this Document

This user manual comprehensively illustrates the use and features of the regression and load testing tool _Xceptance LoadTest_ (XLT). To get the most out of the following explanations and to work effectively with XLT, a basic understanding of web technologies, Java, and the JUnit concept may be helpful. 

h2. What is XLT?

XLT is a tool that lets you easily develop and run both regression and load tests for web applications. Nearly every software providing access via HTTP/HTML can be tested; for the testing of applications using Web 2.0 technologies, XLT features extensive JavaScript support. Besides pure web testing, XLT additionally offers SQL tests, RCP-based application tests, or any other test meant to run on platforms supporting Java. 

h2. XLT Script Developer

XLT Script Developer, a Firefox Add-on, is a convenient user interface for the scripting and running of test cases and test suites. While you navigate through a website, it records the page flow and features a wide range of validations. For the programming of more complex test scenarios or validations serving your individual purposes, test cases can be easily exported to Java and edited in an IDE.  

h2. XLT Framework

The XLT framework offers various programming interfaces for writing individualized test cases in Java. Starting with Java code automatically generated from the test cases recorded with XLT Script Developer, you can extend your test suite using the XLT API. It features the _XLT Scripting API_, that is a high-level command scripting API with a very intuitive syntax, and the "WebDriver API":WebDriverAPI. The XLT framework furthermore includes the lower-leveled _XLT Action API_ based on "HtmlUnit":http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/.

The XLT API provides a programming paradigm to translate all test scenarios into "JUnit4":http://www.junit.org/ tests. The principles of JUnit4 and its annotations are used to implement and tag test cases. Thus, each XLT test is also a JUnit test, which allows you to execute XLT tests just like any other unit test within a build process.
