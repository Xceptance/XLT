            <p>
                An action is part of a transaction and usually consists of one or more requests. When testing web applications,
                an action resembles a page view.
                <xsl:call-template name="show-n-hide">
                    <xsl:with-param name="gid" select="$gid"/>

            </p>
            <div id="more-{$gid}" class="more">
                <p>
                    The data shown here reflects the time spent on the execution routine of an action. Therefore, the action's
                    runtime includes the runtime of a request (an HTTP operation, for instance) and the time required to
                    prepare, send, wait for, and receive the data. If JavaScript is activated, these times are part of the
                    measurement as well. If you actively wait for elements to appear or if you add pauses, the resulting waiting
                    times are also included.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The error count defines the number of errors detected during the validation of the page or errors that
                    occured during loading, such as timeouts or connection resets. See the Request Section for further details
                    on connection resets.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For each action the corresponding
                    <em>Apdex</em>
                    value is listed. The Apdex, short for Application Performance Index, is a measure to express the degree of
                    user satisfaction with the performance of a certain operation (see
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">Wikipedia</a>
                    or the
                    <a href="http://www.apdex.org/">Apdex Alliance</a>
                    for more information). The general format of an Apdex value is
                    <em>P [T]</em>
                    (for instance: 0.75 [2.5]).
                    <em>P</em>
                    is the degree of user satisfaction in percent, represented by a number between 0 and 1.
                    <em>T</em>
                    is the configurable threshold in seconds for the runtime of a certain
                    operation above which the user is
                    usually no longer satisfied with the performance. See below for the resulting ratings based on P and how
                    they are color-coded:

                    The Errors column shows the total number of errors that occurred during the loading of a request (Total). The
                    error count does not include errors detected during the post validation of the received data. Typical error
                    situations are HTTP response codes indicating server-side errors (5xx), timeouts, or connection resets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Runtime column shows the median and the arithmetic mean, the minimum and maximum runtime encountered, and
                    the standard deviation of all data within that series. The Runtime Segmentation shows several runtime
                    segments and the number of requests within the segmentâ€™s definition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the runtime of the test case is shorter than a displayed time period, for instance, if the test runtime
                    was 30 minutes and the time period is given in hours, then the numbers are a linear projection. That means
                    they show a possible outcome of a longer test run, assuming load and application behavior remain the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Runtime Segmentation column helps you evaluate SLA and test success definitions. You can change the setup
                    in the report generator properties.

                <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
                <p>
                    The Bandwidth tab shows the incoming and outgoing bandwidth per request. XLT measures on socket level. Thus,
                    actual incoming and outgoing data is recorded. XLT does not analyze or modify that data when taking the
                    measurements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bytes Sent column comprises all data sent out of the application including overhead such as HTTP(S)
                    headers and SSL protocol data. The Bytes Received column includes all received data and the connected
                    overhead. As the data is measured right above the socket level and before it gets decoded by the
                    application, any compressed traffic is measured as seen by the network layer. The data size you see is not
                    the expanded data as seen by the DOM parser.
                </p>

                <h3>Network Timing</h3>
                <p>
                    The Network Timing tab displays all low-level network timing data that has been measured on socket level.
                    Each measurement point includes the minimum and maximum times and the mean of all gathered data. The
                    following measurement points are shown:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Connect Time: Time needed to establish a connection to the other system. Note that when you use
                        keep-alive semantics during testing, the connect time will mainly be 0 except for the first request of a
                        transaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Send Time: Time needed to send the request to the other system. Depending on the payload and the network
                        speed, this data often amounts to zero or very small values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server Busy Time: Time spent waiting from sending the last bytes to receiving the first bytes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Receive Time: Time spent receiving data from the first to the last bytes received.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time to First Bytes: Total time from the connection start until the first bytes are received. Includes
                        Connect, Send, Server Busy, and Receive Time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time to Last Bytes: Total time from the connection start until the last bytes are received. This is the
                        time needed to connect, send, and receive data. Often it is called network runtime. In contrast, the
                        request runtime includes the network runtime and the application time needed to process header and
                        protocol information and transfer the data from socket level to the application level.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Charts</h3>
                <p>
                    The Summary charts comprise all data across requests to allow for a quick overview on request problems and
                    performance. The tabs in this chart section contain single charts that refer to one request.
                </p>

                    During a page load, a browser typically goes through different phases and reaches different states. This
                    section outlines what time it took to reach a certain state. The timings listed here include primarily page
                    load timings as defined in the

                This section lists all errors that occurred during the load test. The data listed here helps you identify
                application errors or test problems.
                <xsl:call-template name="show-n-hide">

                    Errors are hard failures in the flow of testing. They stop the current execution of the test case (or
                    transaction), log an error, and eventually move on to the next test execution if scheduled to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Errors can occur on transaction, action, or request level. Errors on the request level are counted on action
                    level as well. Action level errors are also counted as transaction errors. A connection reset, for instance,
                    counts as request error and causes the action to fail (counted). As a result, the transaction fails as well
                    which again is counted and logged.

                <p>
                    The Overview section below lists the error message and the count. It ignores the stack trace to sum up common
                    problems without relating them to the test case. The Details section beneath lists the full stack trace next
                    to the test case and the directory in which you can find the data dump for further analysis.

                The tables below show all events that occurred during the load test. Events are used to indicate that the test
                has encountered a situation that is not an error but too important to ignore or to write to the log only. Events can
                also be used to report certain conditions during the load test.

                <p>
                    Events are soft errors or warnings that don't interrupt the flow of testing. Request-level errors also log an
                    event because it depends on the test configuration if they turn into a hard failure as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use the XLT API and create your own events to learn about certain conditions, such as an unavailable
                    product that doesn't cause the test to stop but that needs your attention. A few out-of-stock products may
                    be okay while too many of them could affect the test behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Overview section below lists all events and their respective count in general. The Details section
                    beneath lists and counts all events grouped by test case name, event name, and the particular event message
                    (URLs, for example).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case of too many events, the XLT report will limit the number of collected data points and report dropped counts
                    instead. You can use the reportgenerator.properties to control these limits. If the report displays "XLT::Dropped events due to bad naming",
                    you might have used the name of an event to communicate dynamic data and XLT limited the data collection to avoid
                    memory problems. You can raise the limit, in case you have a higher number of legit event names.
