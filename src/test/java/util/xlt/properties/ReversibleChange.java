/**
 * This class is designed for changes to the XltProperties that can be reverted for example after a test has been
 * finished. Changes to the properties should be reverted after a test to avoid side effects on other tests. The usage
 * is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Get an instance</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #apply()}</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #reverse()}</li>
 * </ol>
 * This class is not thread-safe but that only matters if there are different reversible changes with the same key at
 * the same time.
