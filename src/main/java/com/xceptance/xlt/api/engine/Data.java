/**
 * The {@link Data} interface defines the minimum functionality any data record must implement to be recordable by the
 * XLT engine. Typically, the XLT engine already collects sufficient data (e.g. error and run time values). However, it
 * may be necessary to log other important values as well. For this, a new data record type needs to be created, either
 * by implementing this interface or - preferably - by extending from one of the already existing data record types.
 * <p>
 * Such a data record class must obey the following rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>it must define a type code character to enable XLT to tell one type of data record from the other (Note that the
 * type codes 'A', 'C', 'E', 'J', 'P', 'R', 'T', 'V', and 'W' are already used by the XLT engine.)</li>
 * <li>it must have a name</li>
 * <li>it must have a time stamp</li>
 * <li>it must be able to serialize its state as a list of strings</li>
 * <li>it must be able to reconstruct its state from a list of strings</li>
 * </ul>
 * Serialization and reconstruction: Note that {@link #toList()} on the one side and {@link #setBaseValues(List)} and
 * {@link #setRemainingValues(List)} on the other side work inversely. The data produced by {@link #toList()} during a
 * load test will later be passed to {@link #setBaseValues(List)} and {@link #setRemainingValues(List)} during report
 * creation. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the implementation of these methods is in sync.
 * <p>
 * The data record can be logged using the {@link DataManager}.
