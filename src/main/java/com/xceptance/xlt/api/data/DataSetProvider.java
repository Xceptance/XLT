/**
 * A {@link DataSetProvider} implementation reads one or more test data sets from a data file and returns them to the
 * XLT framework, which in turn executes a certain test case once for each data set (data-driven tests). Note that this
 * feature is currently supported for script test cases only. The framework searches for test data files that are
 * associated with script test cases and reads them in using one of the known data set providers.
 * <p>
 * The XLT framework already knows some default data set providers for common file formats:
 * <ul>
 * <li>.csv - data sets are read from CSV files</li>
 * <li>.sql - data sets are read from a JDBC data source</li>
 * <li>.xml - data sets are read from an XML file</li>
 * </ul>
 * Custom implementations might override existing providers or add providers for new file formats. This is done by
 * configuration, for example in file "project.properties". Use the following property syntax:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * com.xceptance.xlt.data.dataSetProviders.<extension> = <class>
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * To register class "com.yourcompany.FooDataSetProvider" for data set files with the extension ".foo", you need to
 * configure the following property:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * com.xceptance.xlt.data.dataSetProviders.foo = com.yourcompany.FooDataSetProvider
 * </pre>
